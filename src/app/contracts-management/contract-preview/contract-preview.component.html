                <p>1.2 If the material has not been received by the Vendor on the date agreed upon by Vendor and Agency, the Vendor will immediately notify the Agency.

                <p><u>2.0 OBLIGATIONS OF VENDOR</u></p>
                <p>2.1 All designs are to be faithfully reproduced and all displays are to be maintained in accordance with standards of the industry, as outlined by the Outdoor Advertising Association of America (OAAA) in its current publication, Recommended Operating Principles, or their equal.</p>

                <p>2.3 If the advertising space hereunder is part of a package plan (i.e., if specific locations and/or unit IDs have not been provided), the Vendor will notify the Agency of locations at least thirty (30) days in advance of each rotation.</p>
                <p>2.4 The Vendor will provide illumination necessary for full visibility during 6:00 A.M.-to-Midnight period unless otherwise specified in this contract.</p>
                <p>2.5 The Vendor hereby represents and warrants to Agency/Advertiser that the performance of its obligations hereunder will not violate any applicable laws or regulations or require any permits or other governmental authorizations which the Vendor does not hold.</p>
                <p><u>3.0 GENERAL</u></p>
                <p>3.1 All locations are subject to prior approval by the Advertiser and/or the Agency</p>
                <p>3.2 Relationship of Parties. The Agency represents and warrants that it is authorized to place advertising on behalf of the Advertiser named on the face hereof. The Advertiser may, upon notice to the Vendor, change its Agency</p>
                <p>3.3 Rates. All rates and adjustments shall be computed on a basis of thirty (30) days to the month, unless otherwise defined by the period term specified on the front of the contract under "Term of Period."</p>
                <p>3.4 Termination and Loss of Service. (a) The acceptance of this order shall constitute a contract that shall not be subject to cancellation by either party, except as provided in paragraphs 2.5 and 3.4.</p>
                <p>3.4 (b) Advertiser has the right to cancel this contract with 60 days written notice, unless otherwise specified on the face of the contract.</p>
                <p>3.4 (c) Any delay or failure by either party to perform hereunder as the result of force majeure, labor dispute, law, governmental action or order, or similar cause
                  beyond such non-performing party's reasonable control, shall not constitute a breach of contract, but the other party shall be notified immediately and shall be entitled, if such other party is the Agency, at its election, to either immediate termination of this contract, an extension of service, additional service, or credit, all on a pro rata basis, except that in the event of a failure to provide illumination as required herein, the loss shall be compensated by a cash credit to the Agency of 25% of the media value.</p>
                <p>3.4(d) When any media space or location specified in this contract is no longer available due to a loss of the structure for any reason, the Vendor shall offer the Agency a location of at least equal advertising value for the remaining term of the contract; the Agency shall have the right to approve the replacement unit or to terminate this contract on the date the structure is no longer available and no short-rate charge shall be payable for such termination. 3.4(e) If the advertising or sale of the product or service to be advertised under this contract is prohibited by law or government regulation, this contract shall terminate as of the effective date of such law or regulation without short-rate charge. 3.4(f) The Vendor may, upon notice to the Agency, cancel this contract at any time if any of the following conditions is not cured within 10 days after written notice thereof from Vendor to Agency: (i) upon material breach by the Agency, (ii) if the Vendor does not receive timely payment on billings, or (iii) if the Advertiser's credit is, in the Vendor's reasonable opinion, impaired.</p>
                <p>3.5 Terms of Payment</p>
                <p>(a) Agency is acting as an agent on behalf of Advertiser, a disclosed principal. Agency will only be liable for the cost of the advertising purchased and other obligations to Vendor to the extent Agency has been paid by Advertiser for any such amount payable to the Vendor. For amounts not paid to Agency, Vendor will look solely to Advertiser for payment. If pursuant to a court order issued as a result of any preference claim or action under the United States Bankruptcy Code or other avoidance claim or action asserted under the United States Bankruptcy Code, Agency returns to Advertiser or Advertiser's estate any such amount paid to Agency, Vendor will  similarly repay such amount to Agency. Agency agrees that it will defend any such Preference Claim or action or other avoidance action in good faith. Any terms in your invoices, documents or rate cards to the contrary are of no force or effect. Any modifications to this form made by media company are of no force or effect. 3.5(b) Vendor must submit appropriate proof of performance materials (photographs, location lists and signed affidavits) to the Agency in order for payment to be made.</p>
                <p>3.5(c) Advertiser and Vendor must mutually agree upon the use of barter credits (media space/equipment/products) if used as payment for this contract. Vendor must obtain Advertiser's approval for use of such credits.</p>
                <p>3.5(d) The Advertiser is solely responsible for payment of all taxes (other than taxes imposed on vendor or agencies' income) and other levies imposed by any governmental or self-regulatory authority (and the filing of related tax returns) in connection with the purchase by Agency of the above media, including, if applicable, the New York City Commercial Rent Tax ("NYC CRT").</p>
                <p>3.6 Indemnification.</p>
                <p>The Vendor shall hold the Agency and the Advertiser harmless against all claims, demands, debts, obligations, or charges, together with reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements (all hereinafter referred to as "liability"), arising out of: (A) the installation, maintenance, or removal of advertising copy, including all such liability arising out of the Vendor's failure to remove advertising copy within thirty (30) days after the expiration of this contract provided such removal is requested by the Agency, (B) the installation, maintenance, and operation of the physical advertising structure (e.g. bus shelter, billboard), including without limitation any injury caused by the physical advertising structure or any advertising substrate (e.g. vinyl) installed on the physical advertising structure and (C) the breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of Vendor contained in this contract. Advertiser similarly agrees to hold the Vendor harmless against all liability arising out of
                  the content of the advertising copy furnished by the Advertiser.</p>
                <p>3.7 Entire Agreement.</p>
                <p>This contract (and applicable attachments issued by Agency) contains the entire understanding between the parties and cannot be changed or terminated orally. When there is any inconsistency between these standard conditions and a provision on the face hereof, the latter shall govern. Failure of either party to enforce any of the provisions hereof shall not be construed as a general relinquishment or waiver of that or any other provision. All notices hereunder (except for notices under Paragraph 3.4(c) shall be in writing, given only by prepaid telegram or mail, addressed to the other party at the address on the face hereof, and shall be deemed given on the date of first possible receipt. This Agreement and any amendments thereto shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts to be  fully performed therein, without regard to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.</p>
