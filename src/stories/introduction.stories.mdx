# Welcome to Storybook

Before developer will start to develop and implement new components he will need to check our storybook if component
already exists according to feature or shared module. If component shared and reusable and it's not in a shared
folder/module developer need to put component there. For creating stories for components we need to create file with naming like `example.stories.ts`
on one level with `example.component.less`, `example.component.ts`, `example.component.html`. Further instructions for creating stories you can find here
[storybook documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/angular/get-started/whats-a-story).

## Storybook component structure
 * Module Name
   * Folder Name (optional)
      * Component Name

<!-- Designer

Initiate:
Find angular material equivalent ->  Create component/pages in Figma -> add component to existing class of components  -> slack (figma creation/updates) -> stub out on storybook
Flag (figma component/in storybook) components on figma pages as existing components

Changes:
Existing component: slack -> developers make updates
Alternative design (slight changes to existing component): flag component to existing base component -> slack -> developers will create a new component with naming convention to inform alternative changes


Developer

Initiate:
Create new components under the share module
Add to storybook
Communicate to designer
Designer flags figma as storybook component

Changes:
Breaking changes
Story book unit testing
